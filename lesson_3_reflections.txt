When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

  At first, when I work with many peoply in one team. Moreover, it's a nice
  idea to store good projects online to make an opportinity for other people
  to see and use it. And the last but not least, it's very convinient when 
  you work on different computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  Who gives a sh*t? Anyway, it can help me to store well organized data 
  on my remote repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

  Clone is a copy of the whole repository with all commit history. Acctually,
  fork is almost the same. The only difference is that GitHub cloning from 
  one cloud repository to another cloud repository on GitHib servers. As for
  branches, I suppose it's obvious. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

  It helps you to be up-to-date with the last changes. Moreover, If you 
  weren't online for a long time, it's hard to merge last commits.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

  It's going to be sh*ty experience! Well, at least cloud servecies can help.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

  When I want to try something experimental, that mey not work correctly.
